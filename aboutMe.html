            <h2>Currently...</h2>
            <p>
                Hello reader! I am a College of Charleston student working towards a Bachelors of Arts in Computing in the Arts (CITA) with a concentration in Digital Media and a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. Currently, I work as a Resident Assistant, Peer Facilitator, and Research Assistant in the Artifical Intelligence, Music, and Interaction lab with Dr. Manaris. I expect to graduate Spring of 2026. During the day, you can find me cajoling stray cats or boasting about my 4.0 GPA. By night, I hide in my room in pursuit of creative endeavors. 
            </p>
            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>
                I have an interest in the synthesis of STEM and the arts (STEAM), which is part of why I absolutely love my major. Upon arriving at th College of Charleston, I was so pleased to find that a program that combined both of my passions existed. Many people interested in technology who are also artists often neglect the creative side of their psyche. CITA allows me to use both the left and right side of my brain, to feed both parts of my soul. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I started playing violin in winter of 2014, fostering an intense appreciation for music that has lasted nearly a decade. From 2015-2022, I played in various orchestras, including chamber settings, symphony settings, and some solo work. This experience has granted me familiarity with music theory that can be applied to my work in <a href = "https://jythonmusic.me/">Jython Environment for Music</a>, a coding environment that allows those with a background in music to explore code as a new way to compose among other things.
            </p>
            <p>
                Paired with my interest in the auditory arts, I also have a vested interest in visual art. I began practicing digital art in early 2016 by using my finger, my phone, and medibang paint. Since then, I have moved to using a Turcom drawing tablet and Open Canvas 6 on my laptop to generate art. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As both a programmer and artist, I am curious to explore the relationship between software and art, translating into skills involving website design, user interface design, and data sonification among many other things. A potential application of my skillset I would one day like to explore is game design.
            </p>
            <h2>Skillset</h2>
            <p>
                I began learning Java in fall of 2018. That spring, I joined my high school's robotics team (FRC 283) and put my knowlege to use. There, I programmed, did electrical work and wire management, installed pneumatics, machined parts, assembled motors, familiarized myself with ladder logic, and esentially put my grubby little hands onto any project the mentors would allow me to. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Fall 2022 I took a course in <a href = "https://processing.org/">Processing</a>, a graphically oriented programming language meant for artists-turned-programmers. Some of my work resulting from that class can be found <a href = "processing.html">here.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                You can read more about the kind of robotics I participated in <a href = "https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">here.</a> My story can be found <a href = "frc.html">here.</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                Fall 2022 I also took my first Jython course, taught using <a href = "https://jythonmusic.me/">JEM.</a> You can find more about this <a href = "jem.html">here.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Spring 2023 I took my first Python course, as well as a web design class. This portfolio is a result of what I have learned in that we design class.
            </p>
            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>
                Ideally, I would like to head to graduate school after I finish my undergrad. I would like to eventually get a PhD in Computer Science and work as a Professor. Many people see computer science as scary and unapproachable, but I feel like with effort I could introduce material in a way that is easier for students to digest. Ultimately, I want to make the field mroe accessible to those who would not normally have pursued it, in the hope that thinkers from different backgrounds can bring novel ideas to the table and advance the field.
